# OBD9141_C_Core

**OBD9141_C_Core** is a C port/adaptation of the original [OBD9141 Arduino library](https://github.com/iwanders/OBD9141) by Ivor Wanders.  

This version is designed for **ESP-IDF** but includes **framework-agnostic template functions** to allow easy porting to other frameworks or C environments.

## Features

- Complete port from Arduino C++ to C (ESP-IDF).
- Template functions for framework portability.
- Examples for requesting current PIDs, reading DTCs and listing supported PIDs.
- Retains original logic and structure of the OBD9141 library.

## Protocol Support

Currently, **only KWP2000 Fast Init (ISO 14230-4)** has been tested (on a 2005 Opel Corsa). 
Other initialisation handshakes (e.g. K-Line 5-baud init) are included in the code but need community testing and confirmation.

If you have access to different ECUs and can help verify the other handshake modes work correctly, contributions are welcome.

## Wiring Diagram

Below is a wiring diagram of the components used to establish communication with the car:

The wiring and connections originate from the tutorial [Cheap OBD2 Communications on K-line (ISO 9141-2 and ISO 14230-4)](https://www.instructables.com/Low-Cost-OBD2-Communications-on-K-line-ISO-9141-2-/) and were refined with guidance from my professor, **Prof. Stoyan Stoyanov, Assistant Professor (PhD)**, who assisted in designing the wiring setup shown.
